                The trend is to select the various topics in mathematics that are essential to the study  of computer science areas.
                Mathematical topics that are discussed are logic, set theory, algebraic structures, graph theory.
                These topics will support many areas of computer science such as automata, artificial intelligence, syntactic analysis,
                 switching theory, programming languages</h5></p>
